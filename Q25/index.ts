/* Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)*/


// a version that pass the test

let alien_color:string = "green";

if (alien_color=='green'){
    console.log("you just earned five points!")
};

// a version that fail the test

let alien_Color:string='green';

if (alien_Color=="red"){
    console.log('you just earned five points!')
};
